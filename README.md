Python YAML Use Case

Overview

This project demonstrates how to utilize YAML files in Python to manage student data efficiently. The application reads student details from a YAML file and allows users to display and filter the data based on GPA.

Features

Read student data from a YAML file

Display all students in a structured format

Filter students based on GPA criteria

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required package:

pip install pyyaml

YAML File Structure (students.yaml)

Create a file named students.yaml and add the following structured data:

students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7

Python Script (app.py)

This script reads the YAML file and provides options to view and filter student data:

import yaml

def load_data(file_path):
    """
    Load data from a YAML file.
    :param file_path: Path to the YAML file.
    :return: Data loaded from the YAML file.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return data

def display_students(students):
    """
    Display information about all students.
    :param students: List of student dictionaries.
    """
    print("\nAll Students:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")

def filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa):
    """
    Filter and display students with a GPA above the specified minimum.
    :param students: List of student dictionaries.
    :param min_gpa: Minimum GPA for filtering.
    """
    filtered_students = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa]
    print(f"\nStudents with GPA >= {min_gpa}:")
    if filtered_students:
        for student in filtered_students:
            print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")
    else:
        print("No students found.")

def main():
    data = load_data('students.yaml')
    students = data['students']
    display_students(students)
    min_gpa = float(input("\nEnter minimum GPA to filter students: "))
    filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Running the Application

Ensure app.py and students.yaml are in the same directory.

Open a terminal and run:

python app.py

Expected Output

All Students:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Bob, Age: 22, Major: Mathematics, GPA: 3.5
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: David, Age: 23, Major: Chemistry, GPA: 3.2
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Enter minimum GPA to filter students: 3.6
Students with GPA >= 3.6:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Conclusion

This project provides a basic yet powerful way to manage and filter structured data using YAML in Python. You can extend this script to support more operations like sorting, updating, or writing back changes to the YAML file.

🚀 Happy Coding!
